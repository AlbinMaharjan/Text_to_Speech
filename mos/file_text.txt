1)Hello, welcome to our text-to-speech demo!

2)The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

3)Artificial intelligence makes life easier.

4)Django is a powerful web framework for developers.

5)Can you hear this text converted into speech?

6)With text-to-speech technology, we can convert written words into lifelike audio.

7)Speech synthesis allows computers to communicate in a way that feels more natural.

8)This is a demonstration of how you can use Python to generate human-like speech.

9)Text-to-speech systems are widely used in navigation devices and accessibility tools.

10)The future of technology lies in making information accessible to everyone.

11)Text-to-speech technology is transforming the way we interact with devices. By converting text into natural-sounding audio, 
it bridges the gap between written content and auditory experiences. This innovation has applications in education,
 entertainment, and accessibility, making it easier for people with disabilities to engage with the digital world.

12)In recent years, artificial intelligence has significantly improved the quality of text-to-speech systems.
